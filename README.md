# Trying out selenium with firefox web driver

Contains two tests:

  - Basic navigation: Youtube search
  - Tabbed browsing with Wikipedia to Instagram
 

# Basic navigation: Youtube search
Goes to youtube.com searches for "Sample video". Yup, that's it for now. :D

# Tabbed browsing
This goes to a series of webpages
 -  Wikipedia main page
 -  clicks on Geography section
 -  Extracts first word from the Featured location, that'd be a location
 -  Searches Instagram with #<location>
 -  extracts raw image URL from first result and open the image a new tab
 
All of it in separate tabs which took 30 seconds less than when opened in windows instead. Tabs are fast :D!

Demonstrating the use of tabs
